VEHICLE_DETECTION AND COUNTING
CREATED BY RD

This is a  Vehicle counting and classification program 

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and morphological transformation.

Here we defined a vehicle class  named as Vehicle.py

Library Required:
1.Opencv
2.Numpy

For running it, just download all files and run the Vehicle_detection_main.py

Thank you.
